Using an array of animals and a gihpy API, a series of animals based on list appears. 

When you click on a button, we get 10 images from giphy and put them on the page.

When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.

You can use a form that takes the value and puts it into the array and remakes the buttons on the page.

Display the rating of the image on the page (PG, G, etc...). This data is provided by the giphy api.
